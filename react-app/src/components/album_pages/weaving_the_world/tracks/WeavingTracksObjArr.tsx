    description:
      "There are two Caer Caradocs in Shropshire. Both Iron Age hillforts are the supposed last stand of the celtic tribes led by ‘King Caractacus’ against the invading Romans. I had a powerful vision of that battle whilst walking the ramparts at dusk. Their story insisted on being told. ",

      "I came to the hillfort, shrouded in trees. Circled the ditches, feeling so free. And all around me, the earth has my back, hugging me safely, against all attack, attack...",
      "Hawthorn stands proudly, laden with red. Gorse sings bright yellow, bracken’s my bed. Moon shines above me, stars all around, the earth is my pillow, on this soft mound.",
      "Then I see figures moving, hazy at first, digging the ditches, quenching their thirst. Making defences, spikes and stockades, putting up barriers, protection from raids, raids…",
      "Beneath us comes marching, the ranks in full fling. Their armour is glistening, swords ready to swing. To conquer the natives, move people off their land.  The tribe must keep fighting, for their lives they must make a stand.",
      "I feel their panic, see homes overthrown. My kinsmen all slaughtered, taking all that they’ve grown. But their voices still echo, as I slip back in time. Their tale is unfolding, becoming one with mine, mine...",

    hidden by trees, where nobody sees.

    away from the snares, cos no-one goes there.`,

    Weaving the world, yet only a girl.
    The magic is all around her, you can feel it in the air.`,
      `The night draws in, the stars come out.
    You can hear them shout, ‘Look up into the heavens’.
    From out of the trees, creatures appear.
    In their fur and wings, to dance and jump and sing.`,
      `Then came the day, and she always knew it would.
    When they’d catch her if they could
    and take away the forest.
    One by one, the trees came down,
    as they tore up the ground, all around her.`,
      `Now who shall sing? And weave the world?
    No longer the girl, in the forest.
    But her voice sings on, with those who stand.
    Hand in hand, to weave the land.`,
      `Here we stand our sisterly band, 
    hand in hand to weave the land. 
    The magic is all around us, 
    you can feel it in the air.`,

      Without the branches and the leaves on the trees, I cannot breath. 
      Without the song of the birds in the air,
      I cannot dance or sing, of all the beauty in the world, 
      this beautiful world.`,

      Without the feel of the soft earth beneath my feet,
      I have no home, no weight, no grounding and
      no compass on this land, this beautiful land.`,

      `My home is full of creeping things.
      Windows wide to the elements outside.
      Dog hair clogging up my hoover.
      A world of fur and a home to share,
      with all I see, with all I see, with all I see,
      in this beautiful world, this beautiful world.`,

      `Without the gentle humming of the bees, I cannot eat.
      Without the flight of the swallow in the sky, I have no spring.
      Without the call of the owls at night,
      I cannot sleep or rest, 
      knowing the dark is holding all my dreams.`,

      `Without the sight of the soaring hills, I cannot run.
      Without the rushing wind in my hair, I cannot fly.
      Without the view from the mountain tops,
      I cannot see or feel, all the other places in the world, 
      this beautiful world.`,

Flattened circles of grass and meadowsweet where the deer slept, clumps of fur where the badgers shuffled through brambles, the tips of ears betraying hare hiding in their forms, the sound of swallows gathering before their migration back to Africa. I love this field and all its life.",

      flocking over the wild flowers.

      black tips reveal more than they show.
      Hare sleeps beneath the golden barley,

      with the hares.`],
